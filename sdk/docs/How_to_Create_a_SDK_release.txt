This file contains the instructions to create the Software Development Kit to be distributed to developers.

Instructions:

	1. Compile in with "release-profile" the following projects: NMF_POM, NMF_CORE
	2. Open the SDK_GENERATOR project and compile. This generates the folders:
		- CTT
		- NMF Package Assembler
		- Playground
	3. Delete the folder: docs/Javadocs
	4. Open the NMF_JAVADOCS_GENERATOR project and compile with the "release-profile". This generates the new Javadocs in the docs/Javadocs folder
	5. Clean the projects: SDK_GENERATOR, and NMF_JAVADOCS_GENERATOR
	6. Update the MO ICDs if there were changes in the NMF MO XML files
